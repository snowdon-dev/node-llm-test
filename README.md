A test to evaluate the various intelligence modes of large language models. A
linear-time algorithm for generating infinitely many test instances.

Using the most token-efficient method and the simplest token format, the test
presents an easy logical puzzle, with a domain and steps that are native and
natural to a computer agent. The puzzle may involve few or many steps and may
permit the usage of simple tool calls. The solution requires reasoning rather
than computation, and the design eliminates reliance on memorization to ensure
that the test cannot be solved by prior training.

## The puzzle

The quick brown fox lookup test. A test that is solved by the simple act of
looking things up.

LLMs cannot solve this simple puzzle effectively because they rely on
statistical patterns, which this test disrupts by introducing a constructed
language with minimal statistical grounding. If an LLM could truly reason, the
task would be trivial. While identifying the missing word is difficult for a
human, especially someone like me who doesn’t typically engage with grammatical
puzzles, it should, in theory, be simple for an LLM. For it does know what a
pangram is and all the variations or pangrams, and there is many resources that
can be looked up.

For example, given the sequence “the quick brown `[..]`”, an LLM will almost
always guess the correct next word based purely on probability. However, to
pass this test, the LLM must go beyond prediction. It must first reason through
the encoded sentence, translate it into natural English, complete the sentence,
and then convert it back to the encoded form to select the correct missing
word.

The test also reduces to a simple deterministic answer that is very easy to
compute and check. Unlike other puzzles that rely on probabilistic outcomes,
external datasets, or auxiliary GPT/LLM models, results here are unambiguous:
answers are either correct or wrong. And answers may never have been correct
before. However, there exists a possibility that the model can provide an
answer that was unexpected but completes a pangram, it may find a novel
solution. To ensure that novel solutions exist, if you want them, you must
design the input to the puzzle carefully. Testing the result of a novel
solution with a generalized deterministic oracle is inherently difficult—it is
magic, or it may require an LLM prone to false positives and negatives. To
maintain linear-time deterministic test assertions for novel solutions,
pre-compute all possible outcomes based on the input words. Alternatively,
possible novel solution can be manually verified by humans, or simply
considered incorrect. Importantly, providing a novel solution does not
necessarily mean providing the correct solution—it may not correspond to the
most probable variation of the chosen pangram.

Simple puzzles (with few features/levels) may measure the number of tokens
output, or the time taken to complete a correct test. While complicated puzzles
may test the total reasoning capability. This test forces the model to think,
which seems to be achievable to some extent by producing output tokens that
move the task forward towards some end result. However, this is a double edged
sword as the cost per answer is high if the reasoning is not concise. See a
YouTube video by `@t3dotgg` for more information: [I was wrong about
GPT-5](https://youtu.be/k68ie2GcEc4?si=0O6pBuxyHH5creys). With reasoning and
tool calls enabled, a hard test could be `--level 1183`. To see custom levels
configurations, see the web app.

Why select this puzzle instead of a simple, well-worn exercise such as: `Let
𝑘=4`, `(𝑛^2+3𝑛+5) mod r`, `r∈𝑍`, `𝑛=𝑘` and `𝑛∈𝑍`? Although such tasks are quick
generate, they are also very familiar. And it reduces to a fixed sequence of
steps, that can be reused on variants of the problem. Or entirely skipped by
handing the expression to a calculator. In the end, it’s just concise Haskell.
An LLM can classify the input as a Mathematica-like computable expression,
directly yielding the result. In practice, parsers can construct an abstract
syntax tree (AST) for the expression, and most of the semantic annotations
required for execution are either recoverable from the structure or explicit in
the grammar. The AST implicitly encodes type information: for example, no
mathematical parser interprets the `+` operator as string concatenation, so the
digits on either side of the infix operator are necessarily of type number. As
a result, this kind of test can be trivially solved by a non-reasoning system,
or reduced by a reasoning model to just three steps: identify the parameter,
retrieve the appropriate script, and invoke it with the parameter to obtain the
result. For small values of `𝑛` or `r`, the computation could even be
precomputed and stored in a lookup table. Alternatively, the script itself
could be cached at the token level, by respecting known parameters. In
practice, a finite-state automata combined with a calculator (ACU) is
sufficient to solve this test.

There are numerous situations in which a puzzle may reasonably be considered
correct, depending on the evaluation framework. For instance, consider a
scenario where a structured output schema is not specified. If a language model
produces `'every'` but the correct answer is `every`, should this be judged
incorrect? Strictly speaking, it does not match exactly and the test has been
designed to be interpreted as being not correct; however, within the
constraints of a schema, the response would be functionally equivalent and thus
acceptable. However, in the context of code generation and precise logical
tasks, this constitutes a failure to adhere to the given instructions. This
issue also illustrates a broader issue related to **negative feedback
attention**. Providing feedback such as _“no”_ or _“that answer is incorrect”_
can destabilize the model’s reasoning process. In such cases, the system may be
led to reinterpret a correct response as incorrect, a phenomenon sometimes
described as _gaslighting the model_. Public demonstrations of this effect,
often titled along the lines of _“Gaslighting GPT-5 into believing 2+2=5”_,
illustrate how easily a model can be misled by poor feedback. The implication
is significant: in many instances, evaluators must supply the correct answer
explicitly in order to reliably guide the model toward producing the correct
response in future interactions.

## Implementation notes

It’s worth noting that many of the mechanics operate on a 50% chance of
activation. This means that even at the highest level, there is a real
possibility that the test output will be simple—some tests remain trivial to
solve regardless of difficulty. To obtain meaningful results, a large number of
tests must be run, as the majority are expected to fail. For example, when the
mapping order is left-to-right rather than right-to-left, the LLM tends to
produce more correct answers.

I’ve also introduced randomness into the puzzle generation process. This
ensures that even if an LLM has access to solved examples, any newly generated
test will differ significantly in its wording and structure, making
memorization ineffective.

Importantly, while each test is deterministic given a fixed wordlist, seed,
level, and code version—meaning the same inputs will always produce the same
encoded and decoded sentences—this determinism can break if the code version
changes or the underlying wordlist is updated. To preserve reproducibility, I
can provide options for using a static wordlist and locking the process to a
specific code tag. Let me know if you'd like support for that.

If the test code and the pangram list is known, then based on the position of
the missing word, the chance of guessing the correct input is
`1/pangrams.length`. A testee should therefore achieve at least this level of
accuracy; otherwise, its reasoning is performing worse than random guessing.
The default pangrams list length is `9`.

In addition, tests are often simple once excluding native tool calls, requiring
the steps: two lookups, complete the word, find the token, pick the side to
choose the token, and that's your answer. Additional features, may require
running a function (tool call) over the input, or will only be activated with a
50% chance.

If you need to read all the words of the active pangram you may make ~60 lookup
actions. This number does not scale with the number of input words, but with
the size of the chosen pangram.

## Why was this created

I noticed that all AIs seem to fail using the tools that I use. I wondered if
it was because of the lack of public information to train them on. This test
proves it. This was prior to Chat GPT 5.

### Usage tips

- **Combining flags:** these are bit flags — combine with bitwise OR (for
  example `flags = CHAOS_WORDS | INDIRECT_SYMBOLS`), and test membership with
  bitwise AND.
- **Behavioral intent:** many flags control _how_ tokens are transformed,
  obfuscated, or how reasoning is revealed. Treat them as test modes to probe
  model robustness (e.g., obfuscation, partial reasoning, reordered
  instructions).

### Level 0

```console
# zero extra words, zero extra reasoning steps
npx llmtest --level 0
```

```txt
...
Table of mappings:
'vex' 'waltz' {}
'quick' 'fjords' {}
'fjords' 'Big' {}
'Big' 'nymph' {}
'waltz' 'vex' {}
'nymph' 'quick' {}
...

Symbolised sentence with missing word:
fjords quick waltz nymph vex [...]
```

ChatGPT says:

```txt
Missing word (symbolised form): Big
Input sentence (symbolised form): fjords quick waltz nymph vex Big
```

FYI:

```txt
The correct answer is:
fjords quick waltz nymph vex Big
The real sentence is:
Big fjords vex quick waltz nymph
```

This test has a straightforward probabilistic solution, and the LLM
successfully arrives at the correct result without chain of thought. Given the
sentence, the missing word is the one not present in the sequence. From the
lookup table, we observe that the word “**Big**” has two mappings: `'Big' →
'nymph'` and `'fjords' → 'Big'`. Which would make either a likely candidate for
the missing word, if additional words from the domain were present.

At this level, the order of the expression is explicitly provided in the
instructions. This makes it a very easy Level 0 test. The task can become
identifying the one word from the domain that is not present in the sentence.

In this case, the word “Big” stands out as is not included in the sentence.
This structure allows for a simple elimination approach to deduce the missing
word.

It’s important to note that, despite the simplicity of the structure, some
reasoning is still required to arrive at the correct answer due to the way the
test is presented. So the solver must infer the ordering and relationships from
the text. This subtle requirement distinguishes it from a purely mechanical
task and introduces a minimal layer of logical deduction.
